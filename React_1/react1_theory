What is async and defer? -

Normally In a website HTML parsing goes on line by lineand when it hits a script tag the HTML parsing stops and script loads and then script executed and then parsing starts again.
But in case of async the script is loaded while the parsing is also going on i.e. asynchronously and when the script is loaded it just start executed immediately pausing parsing and then again parsing starts.
While in case of defer the script is loaded while parsing also going on but the script is executed at the last when all parsing is done. So defer can be used to maintain the order of scripts execution.
